USAGE of dump()

First of all, you must instantiate a QDumper object:

$qd = new Onedevs\QDump\QDumper();

QDump brings you two main methods: dump() and trace().

To dump any expression or variable user the dump() method:

$foo = 'bar';
$qd->dump($foo);

Yo can call dump() with more than one argument:

$foo = 'bar';
$baz = 'qux';
$qd->dump($foo, $baz);

----------------

You can view the call stack calling the trace() method:

$qd->trace();
