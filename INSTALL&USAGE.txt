You can install QDump into your project using composer:

composer require richirm/qdump

Or, if you don't use composer, you can download it from
https://github.com/richi-rm/qdump and include the
following file:

include 'qdump/include.php'


---------------
USAGE of dump()
---------------

First of all, you must instantiate a QDumper object:

$qd = new RichiRM\QDump\QDumper();

QDump brings you two main methods: dump() and trace().

To dump any expression or variable user the dump() method:

$foo = 'bar';
$qd->dump($foo);

You can also call dump() with more than one argument:

$foo = 'bar';
$baz = 'qux';
$qd->dump($foo, $baz);


----------------
USAGE of trace()
----------------

You can view the call stack calling the trace() method:

$qd->trace();
